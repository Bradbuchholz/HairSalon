# Hair Salon
_By Brad Buchholz_
## Description

### _Eau Claire's Salon_
_You've been referred by Pierre to his friend Claire who is the owner of a hair salon called Eau Claire's Salon. She has contracted you out to create an MVC web application to help her manage her employees (stylists) and their clients. Claire should be able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist._

_For example, Pierre might supply croissants to a vendor called "Suzie's Cafe" once a week. Pierre may want to create a new Vendor to represent the cafe and add new Orders to it to help keep track of his expanding business relationships._
